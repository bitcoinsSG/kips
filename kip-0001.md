The following KIP was posted on Kaspa's discord server at 07/06/2022 ([message link](https://discord.com/channels/599153230659846165/844142778232864809/994251164524748820)), 
it has been implemented ([rusty-kaspa](https://github.com/kaspanet/rusty-kaspa)), and is brought here for completeness.
 
### Motivations
* Refactored and extensible codebase. The current codebase has evolved through
years of R&D and uncertainty and has a decent amount of technical debt. Some
components are fragile and are hard to maintain and extend. A reform of the
codebase is crucial for making it accessible to new developers and for making it
possible to implement new major features (e.g., smart contract support; consensus
ordering algorithm upgrade)
* Efficiency and performance. In order to reach maximal efficiency and higher block
and transaction rates, we suggest that the system needs to be rewritten in a
performance-oriented programming language and with a performance oriented
mindset. Using Rust for the rewrite will open many opportunities in this aspect, while
still providing many high-level constructs which are essential for realizing a complex
system like Kaspa.

### Goals
* Implementing the Kaspa full-node in Rust
* Reaching higher efficiency and improved performance with current net params
* Benchmarking various network params through devnets and testnets, analyzing the
trade-offs, and settling for some BPS, TPS configuration for the long-run.
* Simplified and modularized codebase
* Incorporation of pending features
* Documentation (including flows and sub-protocols)
* Comprehensive benchmarking suite

### Milestones
1. A node partially implemented in Rust. Namely, all core logic and core algorithms from
consensus level and below should be implemented correctly in Rust. There are two
possible ways to test such a partial system. The exact method is to be determined by
relevant time and effort estimations. The two options are:
   1. Hybrid go-rust full-node which can connect to current mainnet and testnet and
function properly. External components including the P2P and RPC layers will
remain in Go. Both system parts will be attached through a cross-language
interop API.
   2. A test level consensus API in Rust which can be validated extensively
through existing and new integration tests.

2. The above partial node with specific performance targets. There are two types of
possible performance gain:
   1. Single-core performance improvement: we expect a natural gain from the
usage of Rust alone and the lack of a GC. Additionally, DB optimizations such
as binary serialization and Block Header compression can affect the runtime
as well (initial target: 5x)
   2. Multi-core scaling: Implementation of parallelism within consensus. This
includes organizing consensus block and transaction processing in a way that
allows parallelism of independent tasks (initial target: strong scaling; might
require high BPS for being meaningful)

3. New features on consensus level:
   1. Header pruning. The outcome of this should be a node running for long
periods with nearly fixed DB size (this is currently achieved by resyncing).

4. A full-node implemented completely in Rust. This includes P2P, RPC, IBD, Mempool,
Mining manager and all remaining components. RPC should be redesigned to allow
a complete API change (if so desired), though backward compatibility might be a
requirement.

5. New features on node/network level:
   1. Archival nodes P2P
   2. Header compression on P2P level

6. Testnet performance targets:
   1. 1000 TPS (using 1-5 BPS)
   2. 10 BPS
   3. 32 BPS
   4. 100 BPS (or max possible, since there is a trade-off of increased header size
when more blocks are mined in parallel)

7. (Mainnet BPS and TPS targets are subject to many system-wide aspects and
tradeoffs. The goal of this rewrite is not to end with mainnet running with 100 BPS,
but rather to allow exploring this parameter space and making the right decisions)
